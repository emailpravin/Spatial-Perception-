You will be given two images:

Image 1: an overhead view with a grid and labeled rows and columns.

Image 2: a perspective view of the same scene taken from a camera located somewhere above the grid.

Task: Identify the single grid cell in Image 1 that contains the camera’s ground-projection point (the point on the map directly beneath the camera).

Rules:

Use the row label and column label exactly as shown in Image 1.

Output exactly one row and exactly one column (no ranges, no alternates, no “between” answers).

Do not output where the camera is pointed—only the camera location cell.

If uncertain, still choose the best single row and column.

Also provide the confidence score (0-100) of your choice, where 0 is the least confident and 100 is the most confident.

Output format (must be exact, three lines):
CellRow=<row_label>
CellCol=<col_label>
Confidence Score=<confidence score>
